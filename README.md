## Work Experience
Research Assistant @ the University of Texas at Arlington
  - Lead researcher on a three-year, $490,000 National Science Foundation grant, driving efforts to optimize software testing by minimizing redundant checks on unchanged code resulting in six peer-reviewed publications, with an additional paper under submission.
  - Spearheaded multiple research projects from inception to completion—defining research goals, retrieving and preparing data, conducting in-depth exploratory analysis, developing data models, and automating workflows for efficiency and scalability.
  - Presented research findings at international conferences, effectively communicating complex concepts to a global audience and driving discussions on advancements in formal methods and software engineering.
Teaching Assistant @ the University of Texas at Arlington
  - Led a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, fostering a deep understanding of advanced software engineering and discrete structures through structured guidance, mentorship, and hands-on problem-solving.
  - Demonstrated strong leadership, directly contributing to an overall GPA increase from 3.04 at midterm to 3.21 by the end of the semester through strategic academic support and targeted interventions.
  - Meticulously analyzed performance trends and documented insights through spreadsheets, and detailed reports. Provided personalized guidance to students, equipping them with the skills and strategies needed for continuous improvement.
