## Projects
# Predicting Traffic Accident Severity in Texas ðŸš—  

## Overview  
This project leverages machine learning to predict the severity of traffic accidents in Texas using **crash data from December 28, 2014, to December 28, 2024**. The analysis focuses on key risk factors, including **alcohol involvement, speeding, young drivers (16-22), and motorcycle-related crashes**.  

## Key Objectives  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** â€“ Clean and transform raw crash data for predictive modeling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identify patterns and correlations between accident severity and contributing factors.  
- **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify accident severity.  
- **Model Optimization & Evaluation** â€“ Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch  
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  

## Potential Use Cases  
- ðŸš¦ **Traffic Safety Analysis** â€“ Identify high-risk crash scenarios to improve road safety.  
- ðŸ“‘ **Policy Recommendations** â€“ Support data-driven decisions for traffic regulations and road planning.  
- ðŸ”® **Real-Time Prediction** â€“ Potential integration into traffic monitoring systems to forecast accident risks.
